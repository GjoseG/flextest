A practice project I made attempting to master Flexbox and CSS.
Feel free to use this template or expand on it however you'd like.

I have labeled the sections of the page in the style sheet and added tags to many elements to help you expand upon this template.

Feel free to message me if you have any questions or if you run accross any bugs or issues.

Thank you for taking the time out of your day to view my project.
